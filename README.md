# The Zeon Algebra in Lean
In this project we implement zeon algebras into the proof assistant Lean.

## Description
Zeon algrebas are abelian algebras with the property that each of the generators in their generating set square to 0. In this project we formalize the generalized zeon algebra into Lean using existing results from mathlib, Lean's mathematical library. Past simply defining the algebra we have also constructed a Basis for the algebra, gotten a GradedAlgebra structure, and formalized some basic zeon results.
